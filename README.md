# Instacart-Python
This repository contains Python code used to analyze Instacart grocery data. I wrote the code during my completion of CareerFoundry's data analytics course.
## Background Information
Instacart is a grocery service that allows customers to purchase groceries online and either pick up the groceries from a local grocery store or have the groceries delivered to their home.  While Instacart already has strong sales, they are always looking to uncover more information about their sales patterns.  I was tasked with answering questions from the sales and marketing teams regarding popular items; days and times when the site receives heavy traffic; differences in ordering habits by location, age, loyalty status, etc.; and other such business questions.  As the dataset was very large, I did most of the analysis in Python.
## Data
I used open-source data from 2017 made available by Instacart [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017).
## Deliverables
For a detailed summary of my findings as well as a population flow and a description of the various wrangling and constistency checks performed on the data, see the [Final Report](05%20Sent%20to%20client/Final%20Report.xlsx)
